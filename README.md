Signature addon
===============

This addon renders a [signature pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad)
in a form field, allowing someone to electronically enter their written
signature. The resulting signature image is stored as a data URI in the model
field.


Installation
------------

The easiest way is to install is with bower, this will also include dependencies:
```bash
bower install angular-schema-form-signature
```

Usage
-----
You will need to specify the `signature` dependency in your app definition, this
is for the [angular signature](https://github.com/legalthings/angular-signature)
module.

```js
angular.module('yourModule', ['schemaForm', 'signaure']);
```

The signature add-on adds a new form type, `signature`.

|   Form Type    |       Becomes       |
|:---------------|:-------------------:|
|   signature    |  a signature widget |

### Resulting Value

On submission, your model will contain a data URI representation of the signature
which was input by the user.

### Validation

The field will be valid as long as something has been entered. This prevents
someone from not entering a signature.

Form Type Options
-----------------
The `signature` form only supports setting the width, height and the text of the reset button.
If you would like an option to be present, open an issue or pull request for it.

### Examples

Here's an example form declaration:

```javascript
{
  key: 'signature',
  type: 'signature',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  resetButtonText: 'Clear signature'
}
```

Development
-----------
Install dev dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Install project dependencies:
```bash
bower install
```

Run gulp to generate output:
```bash
gulp
```
